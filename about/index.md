Hi.. I am **Rohit Gupta**. I am currently working as a developer at [Plivo](http://plivo.com), a YC-Backed Telephony Startup.

I am passionate about technologies and am currently working in the area of convergence of telephony over web. Some of the projects I have worked upon include automating the cloud management over [Amazon Web Service](http://aws.amazon.com) using [boto](https://github.com/boto/boto), enabling High Availability, failover solution and auto-scaling to ensure zero downtime and un-interrupted services to Plivo customers.
I am also a FOSS enthusiast and was instrumental in promoting it by organizing the first ever [linux InstallFest](/first-ever-linux-installfest-in-kgec.html) (with fedora 10) in my [university](http://www.kgec.ac.in/), founded a GNU/Linux User Group and presented FOSS tech talks. I was also a speaker at:

- PyCon India 2012: Gave a talk on [Managing AWS Cloud with Python](http://in.pycon.org/2012/funnel/pyconindia2012/33-managing-aws-cloud-with-python)
- PyCon Singapore 2013: Gave a talk on [Build service health dashboard using Shinken](https://pycon.sg/schedule/presentation/23/)
