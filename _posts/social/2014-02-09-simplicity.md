Today, I changed the title of my blog to **Simplicity**. A simple thought, life, action and relation is somewhere lost in this complicated world! **Simplicity is an aquired taste**. A taste, which helped google dominate the web, Apple to be regarded as the biggest brand and Mahatma Gandhi to become the father of the Nation.

The first thing to realize about simplicity is that, it does not mean *LIMITED*. **Simplicity is about subtracting the obvious and adding the meaningful**. The problem here is that the 'obvious' is not so OBVIOUS :(

Simplicity also means, the achievement of maximum effect with minimum means. A absence of luxury or showiness, enjoying plainess.

**And as always, Thanks for reading :)**
