    When I hear your name, something happens,
    My heart misses a beat and then, doubles its speed
    Thats why I call you - "MY DREAM GIRL"

<br />

**I Wonder**,
> I forget everything while I miss you  
> But, I can't forget a single thing about you..

**I think**,
> I get nostalgic while talking to you,  
> Dream things like being forever with you!!

**Surprise**,
> You have taken so much space in my heart,  
> That even God seems inferior than you

**Bonding**,
> I may need a psychiatrist for my madness,  
> But forgetting myself seems easier than you

**Despair**,
> If in reality, I get you never!!  
> I believe: In love, A moment lasts forever

**Hope**,
> But if dreams, do ever come true,  
> I just wanna spend my life with you

                                MY DREAM GIRL
