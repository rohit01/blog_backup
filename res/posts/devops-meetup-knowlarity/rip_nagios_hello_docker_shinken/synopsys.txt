Nagios:

* Great infrastructure monitoring tool
* Some people still conder as a Standard for IT infrastructure monitoring
* History: Years in service
* Agent and polling based

Shinken:

* Shinken was written by Jean Gab√®s as a POC for next version of Nagios
* Turned down by nagios authors.. became an independent project
* Nagios core replacement

Docker:

* Built on top of LXC
* Complete package - Repo, process isolation, Fast, less overhead
* Provides the benefits of VM without much of its overhead

Nagios complecated relationship:

* Active Development: Not under active development
* Multi DC deployment: Kindof hack. Difficult to manage and scale
* Performance: Written in C. Good. However, setting up a cluster is difficult
* Outdated: Same old features. No innovation
* User interface: Good but old. Slow in terms of architecture - parsing .dat file. However, you can plugin new UI

Shinken: Start dating again:

* Active Development: Written in python and has a very active community
* Multi DC deployment: Add new pollers (one of the shinken daemons) in each DC and you are done
* Performance: Python - Slow compared to Nagios. Cluster setup is easy. NRPE booster module
* Modern: Support for AWS, dynamic inventory, configuration in a database, package installer and many more.
* User Interface: Modern & Simple but basic. However, you can use multiple user interface, if you want.
* Easy Switch: Plug and play replacement. Almost 100% compatible with nagios configuration.

Docker + Shinken: Happily married

* Setting up Shinken or nagios still takes time
